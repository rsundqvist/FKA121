In the course we will program in the c-language. We will use the gcc compiler and 
the make utility to compile the code. How to install these are described below:

1) Linux:   The gcc compiler and make utility should already be installed on the
            system, at least on Ubuntu and StuDAT (Chalmers student workplaces).

2) Mac OSX: The gcc compiler and make utility is part of the Command Line Tools 
            in Xcode. Xcode can be downloaded for free in App Store.

3) Windows: The gcc compiler and make utility is part of the basic package of 
            the MinGW software, which can be download from 
            ’http://www.mingw.org'. Instructions on how to install and setup 
            MinGW can be found on the ’Getting Started’ page on the MinGW 
            homepage. Once this is done you will obtain a linux-like terminal
            from where you can compile and run the code using linux commands.  


In E1 you will also use GNU Scientific Library (gsl). gsl is installed on the 
student computers. For instructions on how to install it visit 
'www.gnu.org/software/gsl/'.
